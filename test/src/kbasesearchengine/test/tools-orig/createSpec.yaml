# This is a minimal generated search transformation specification for the KBase search system.
# The specification format is YAML (http://yaml.org/).

# The name of the type in the search system.
global-object-type: Genome

# The name of the type in the search system as it should be displayed in a UI.
ui-type-name: Genome

# The data source of the objects.
storage-type: WS

# The name of the type in the data source.
storage-object-type: KBaseGenomes.Genome

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Once a type version is established in the search system, the type version
# CANNOT be changed or given a new version number (i.e. by changing the ordering of the versions)
# without dropping the ElasticSearch indexes for the type.

# This list contains different versions of the parsing rules used to parse the specified
# storage-object-type. The list is ordered by version number. Each parsing rule version results
# in a corresponding search type version. The mapping between the source storage-object-type
# version and the target search type version is specified by the type mappings.
# If no type mapping is specified for this type, the latest version is used.

        # The following rules describe which fields are extracted from the source object and
        # transforms performed upon said fields.
        indexing-rules: []
        
# The indexing rules above are set to an empty list. An examples of a 3 item list of indexing rules
# is below:
#           -
#               # Extract a string from the /id path. The key name will be id.
#               path: id
#               keyword-type: string
#           -
#               # Extract a string from the /domain path. The key name will be domain.
#               path: domain
#               keyword-type: string
#           -
#               # Extract a full-text search field from the /taxonomy path. A full-text field is
#               # parsed into tokens which can be searched on individually, as opposed to a string
#               # field which is an opaque block and must be matched in its entirety.
#               # The key name will be taxonomy.
#               path: taxonomy
#               full-text: true
